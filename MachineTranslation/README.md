Machine translation is the task of translating a sentence in a source language to a different target language.

Approaches for machine translation can range from rule-based to statistical to neural-based. More recently, encoder-decoder attention-based architectures like BERT have attained major improvements in machine translation.

One of the most popular datasets used to benchmark machine translation systems is the WMT family of datasets. Some of the most commonly used evaluation metrics for machine translation systems include BLUE, METEOR, NIST, and others.
