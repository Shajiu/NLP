Question Answering is the task of answering questions (typically reading comprehension questions), but abstaining when presented with a question that cannot be answered based on the provided context.

Question answering can be segmented into domain-specific tasks like community question answering and knowledge-base question answering. Popular benchmark datasets for evaluation question answering systems include SQuAD, HotPotQA, bAbI, TriviaQA, WikiQA, and many others. Models for question answering are typically evaluated on metrics like EM and F1. Some recent top performing models are T5 and XLNet.
